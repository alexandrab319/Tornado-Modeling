# Tornado-Modeling
I studied a model of wind speed in a tornado using vector calculus. The model included a vector field for wind direction and a scalar function for wind speed. I calculated the curl, work done, and wind flow through three surfaces. I analyzed the predicted tornado behavior to discuss model limitations.
